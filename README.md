Setup

Before you can start using **Mainframer Integration** plugin you must configure your [remote machine](https://github.com/buildfoundation/mainframer/blob/3.x/docs/getting-started/remote-machine.md) and [local machine](https://github.com/buildfoundation/mainframer/blob/3.x/docs/getting-started/local-machine.md) (omitting last *Configuration* section, because the plugin will do it for you).

Usage
-----

### Actions

#### Configure Mainframer in Project

This is an initial action you need to perform to configure Mainframer in your current project. It starts with fetching a list of all available tool releases. You can select a Mainframer tool version you are interested in. It will check if your opened project contains a *mainframer.sh* file and if not it will download it for you.

#### Select configurations to inject mainframer or restore to default

This action comes with a dialog containing selectable lists of run/debug configurations and default configurations (templates):

![](readme/select_configurations.png)

After clicking *OK* button plugin will modify all your created run configurations. For each selected configuration it will remove default *before launch* task and inject **Mainframer Make** task.

Simultaneously, for each unselected configuration, this action will restore default *before run* task, enabling project local build.

Selecting a checkbox at the bottom of the dialog indicates that you want to override all **Mainframer Make** tasks properties, set separately per run configuration, with defaults from plugin settings (defined in *Tools > Mainframer*).

### Switching between local and remote compilation

Just press the blue button:
